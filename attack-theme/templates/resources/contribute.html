                        Due to the major change to ATT&CK with the addition of sub-techniques, we are asking for the community’s patience 
                        because we will be delayed in incorporating contributions into Enterprise and PRE-ATT&CK over the next several months until we complete the sub-technique 
                        migration. You can read more about sub-techniques and why this is such a big change for ATT&CK <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-sub-techniques-preview-b79ff0ba669a">here</a>.
                        For new technique contributions, you may continue to send them to <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a>, 
                        but please keep in mind that we may not reply for several months as we work to include contributions into the sub-technique 
                        refactoring. Contributions for Mobile will continue as normal. For new Group and Software contributions to Enterprise or PRE-ATT&CK, we ask that you please temporarily put a hold on sending these to us 
                        until we make the change to sub-techniques. 
                        (This will allow us to focus on migrating existing Groups and Software, as new contributions would add to our workload.) 
                        We do appreciate your contributions and feedback, but ask for your patience and understanding over the next several months 
                        as we focus all our efforts on adding sub-techniques.

                        If you send technique contributions, it may take us several months to get back to you. We may ask you follow-up questions 
                        to help us understand your contribution and gather additional information. 
                        We recommend you read our philosophy paper to understand our approach to maintaining ATT&CK so that we get the right 
                        details up front. If we find the contribution fills a gap, then we will make edits and send you a draft version of the 
                        technique page for your review prior to it being published, listing you as a contributor if desired. The next content update 
                        will not be until 2020 and will be in a parallel site to attack.mitre.org to allow the community time to incorporate 
                        sub-techniques.

                    You can help contribute to ATT&amp;CK.

                <p>
                    ATT&amp;CK is in a constant state of development. We are always on the lookout for new information to help
                    refine and extend what is covered. If you have additional techniques, know about variations on one already covered,
                    have examples of techniques in use, or have other relevant information, then we would like to hear from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking for contributions in the following areas in particular, but if you have other information
                    you think may be useful, please reach us at <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All contributions and feedback to ATT&amp;CK are appreciated. Due to the high volume of contributions,
                    it may take us about a week to get back to you. We may ask you follow-up questions to help us understand your contribution
                    and gather additional information. We recommend you read our <a href="https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/mitre-attack-design-and-philosophy">philosophy paper</a> to understand
                    our approach to maintaining ATT&amp;CK so that we get the right details up front. If we find the contribution fills a gap,
                    then we will make edits and send you a draft version of the technique or Group/Software page for your review prior to
                    it being published, listing you as a contributor if desired. Content updates happen roughly every 3-6 months.

                            We appreciate your help to let us know about what new techniques and technique variations adversaries 
                            and red teamers are using. You can start by emailing us the technique name, a brief description, and 
                            references or knowledge about how it is being used by adversaries or red teams. 
                            We suggest you take a close look at what we already have on our site, paying attention 
                            to the level of abstraction of techniques. Since we are working on adding new technique details
                            constantly, we will deconflict what you send with what we’re working on. We’ll provide feedback
                            and work with you to get the content added.

                        While we are looking for new techniques for Windows, macOS, and Linux, we are interested in macOS and Linux 
                        techniques in particular since there is a lack of publicly available threat intel for techniques used against
                        those systems. This leads to gaps in the knowledge base that you can help fill.

                    <p>
                        We map Group and Software examples on our site, and there is too much open source threat intelligence 
                        reporting for us to keep up on everything. We appreciate your help with referenced information about 
                        how Groups and Software samples use ATT&CK techniques. 
                        Threat intelligence contributions are most helpful to us when they are in the specific format we have 
                        on our website, including citing techniques and group names or associated groups to 
                        publicly-available references. We ask that you provide the technique name, a brief description of 
                        how the technique is implemented, and the publicly-available reference.

                        We often don’t have direct access to endpoint or network log data for technique use in incidents. 
                        We’re always looking for partners who would be interested in sharing relevant data from logs that 
                        show how adversaries are using ATT&CK techniques beyond what appears in threat reporting.

                        We appreciate any information you can share with us about your specific use case or 
                        application of ATT&CK, and particularly any success stories you’ve had as a result.
